  <h1>Martha Lane Fox</h1>
  <p class="title">CEO & Founder, Lastminute.com</p>
  <p> After developing an early interest in the internet, Martha Lane Fox founded Lastminute.com in 1998. She has since gone on to become perhaps the UK’s most powerful digital campaigner after she was appointed to be the government’s Digital Inclusion Champion and later entered the House of Lords as its youngest female member. In a recent Richard Dimbleby Lecture she said: “I don’t know exactly how it happened but the absence of women is having a profound impact on the services we use everyday. </p>

  <h1>Susan Wojcick</h1>
  <p class="title">Current Head, YouTube</p>
  <p> Susan Wojcicki grew up surrounded by Stem: her father was a physics professor at Stanford University and, as a child, she lived on campus with famous mathematicians as neighbours. She joined Google the year after it was founded and has been behind many of the search engine’s most defining features, including creating the first ever Google Doodle. She became head of YouTube last year, after it was bought by Google in 2006. </p>

  <h1>Belinda Parmar</h1>
  <p class="title">Founder, Little Miss Geek</p>
  <p> One of the UK’s leading campaigners to get more women into tech, Belinda Parmar is the founder of Little Miss Geek and chief executive of Lady Geek. She was awarded an OBE for services to women in technology in 2014 following campaigns like Her In Hero which brought in support from senior politicians. She has explained her campaigning, saying: “Diversity is important in any industry, but is especially relevant when it comes to technology. Tech is the way that world talks to each other.” </p>

  <h1>Sheryl Sandberg</h1>
  <p class="title">COO, Facebook</p>
  <p> As chief operating officer of Facebook, Sheryl Sandberg is one of the world’s most high-profile women in the tech sector. After an economics degree and a stint at Google, she was hired by Facebook in 2008 and later became the first woman on the company’s board. She has also been a champion of gender equality – in her book about women in work, Lean In, she writes: “We stand on the shoulders of the women who came before us, women who had to fight for the rights that we now take for granted.” </p>
